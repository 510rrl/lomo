## Weather Fetch Website

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?  
To provide a responsive user experience for communities using either mobile or desktop websites to help find relevant weather information.
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
I built this project to practice my API fetch skills. I successfully created the API however I had issues in deployment.
- What problem does it solve?
I have a website deployed. Need to fix merging the style and the page.

- What did you learn?
How to use API keys.


## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

What are the steps required to install your project? Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment running.

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.
normalize.css v8.0.1 | MIT License | github.com/necolas/normalize.css
Also had help from a Bootcamp tutor.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
5 day weather forecast provided the API.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.
normalize.css v8.0.1 | MIT License | github.com/necolas/normalize.css

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).

üèÜ The previous sections are the bare minimum, and your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

![badmath](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/lernantino/badmath)

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
